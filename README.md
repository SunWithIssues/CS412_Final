# CS412_Final: A Look at Cataloguing Artworks
## About
This is all the information relating to my final project "A Look at Cataloguing Artworks". This project fit the requirements necessary for Wei Tang's "CS412: Introduction to Machine Learning" at the University of Illinois at Chicago. (This was the Fall 2021 Semester course.) The work looks to answers questions on MoMA's public collection.

## The Final Project
The final project had three components: a written report, presentation, and code.
- The [documents](/documents) folder contains the presentation and written report. In there, I go in detail on what my observations were, the questions that I asked surrounding the data, and any pitfalls which were presented.
- The [code](/code) folder contains a Python file (extension .py), a Jupyter Notebook file (extension .ipynb), and tables (extension .csv). The Python file has limited code inside, as I quickly switched to Jupyter Notebook for my data exploration and research. I leave it just as a testament to the beginning of my research. The tables are created on demand within the Jupyter Notebook file.
- The [collection](/collection) folder redirects to Muesum of Modern Art's (MoMA) repository. This was used to obtain the data for the research.
